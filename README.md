# Drink or DOOM ‚ö†Ô∏èüç∫üíÄ

> A totally over-engineered reminder system, built with **C++** and **EDK II**, that nags you to drink water‚Ä¶ or else.

## üìú Project Description
This project has **two main components**:
At its core, Drink or DOOM is a gloriously over-engineered solution to a problem nobody really needed solved ‚Äî reminding you to drink water. Sure, there are plenty of apps and timers that do this quietly and politely. But where‚Äôs the fun in that?

Instead of a gentle nudge, this project goes full drama mode: it actually messes with your computer‚Äôs boot process (in the tested, controlled environment, of course). If you ignore your hydration reminder, your machine gives you a digital guilt trip every time you reboot.

It‚Äôs a perfect blend of high-tech wizardry, harmless sabotage, and cheeky motivation. So while it‚Äôs technically useful ‚Äî it‚Äôs mostly useless because nobody wants their bootloader replaced over a glass of water. But hey, if you do, here‚Äôs your chance!


1. **Custom UEFI App** ‚Äì Built using the [EDK II](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2) environment.  
   - When run at boot, it checks a `flag.bin` file in the EFI System Partition (ESP) and reacts accordingly.  
   - Built as a standalone `.efi` binary for x86_64 systems.

2. **C++ Reminder App** ‚Äì A Windows application that:  
   - Shows a timed reminder to the user.  
   - Records the response in `flag.bin` (0 = responded, 1 = ignored).  
   - (Safe mode) Writes to a **test ESP image** instead of modifying the real bootloader.

## üöÄ Features
- **Timed reminders** with keyboard detection.
- **Flag system** to communicate between the OS and EFI app.
- **EDK II UEFI app** that reads the flag and acts accordingly.
- **Safe-mode injector** to work with test ESP images.
- **Cross-environment development** ‚Äì C++ for user-space, C for UEFI.
